# shiny_group_simulator
This is a simulation app showing the relationship between group distribution and AUC performance, in order to demonstrate the fact that the mixing proportion of trajectories groups has impact on the temporal pattern of performance of predictive model as measured by AUC. 

This simulator is has three output plots:
1.  Simulated trajectory groups
2.  group by labels
3.  AUC performance
